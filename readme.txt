Names: Ryan Clare, Mateo Godoy
Assignment Number: 3

Contributions: (just gonna use the third person because it's easier)

  We did partner programming on the assignment, Facetiming and using git to keep up with one another's
  work. Our process was very fluid with each of us having input at every step of the way. We did break up the
  programming so that both of us had the opportunity to get hands on coding experience. For the database.py file,
  Mateo programmed while Ryan looked over the notes and made sure that there were no pylint errors. For the flask_app.py file
  we did the opposite. Ryan made the runserver.py file on his own which was the easiest python program to build. 
  For the majority of this assignment we sat down next to each other and went through section by section.
  In the end when it came to exception handling, we broke the work up again - with Mateo testing the conditions on the provided
  working program and our own while Ryan wrote the code for the exception handling in both programs. 

  In summary I would say that the division of work was very even and we both got a lot out of the assignment.
